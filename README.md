imagenetloader.torch
====================

some old code that i wrote, might be useful to others.

If your dataset is of the form:

dogs/[image files of dogs]
cats/[image files of cats]
.
.
.

then this loader loads the dataset nicely, and you have class-balanced sampling, a test iterator and other useful things.
